# DIY Fundraising Guide: Stack Sats for Sovereign Art

Welcome to the Bitcoin For The Arts DIY Fundraising Guide! If you're a Bitcoiner, artist, or supporter passionate about uncensorable creativity, you can create your own event or campaign to raise funds for our mission.

Every sat you stack helps us pay artists directly in Bitcoin—our allocation policy targets the majority of donations to creator support. No experience needed—we’ll provide templates, tips, and support. Let’s build the renaissance together.

## Why DIY fundraising?
- **Empower creators:** Your event can fund an artist’s next masterpiece or workshop.
- **Bitcoin-native:** Accept donations in BTC/Lightning for instant, low-fee impact.
- **Easy & flexible:** From virtual zaps to gallery nights—do what fits your style.
- **Perks:** We can promote your event, provide logos/templates, and feature you in our public updates (opt-in).

## Fundraising ideas (start small or go big)
- **Bitcoin Art Night:** Host a virtual/in-person showcase—charge entry. *(Example goal: $5K)*
- **Satoshi Streamathon:** Livestream your art creation; supporters zap sats via Lightning. *(Example goal: $1K)*
- **Gallery Zap Party:** Partner with a local space; place QR codes for BTC donations. *(Example goal: $2K)*
- **Peer-to-peer campaign:** “Fund 5 artists with me!” *(Example goal: $500/person)*
- **Corporate match day:** Ask your employer to match BTC/fiat donations. *(Goal: double gifts)*
- **Low-time auction:** Donate an artwork and direct proceeds to the mission. *(Example goal: $3K)*

## Step-by-step: how to run your fundraiser
1. **Pick your idea & set a goal:** Choose from above or create your own. Start with a realistic target (e.g., $1K).
2. **Register your event:** Email us with name/date/goal and how you want to accept donations. We’ll send templates + a promo kit.
3. **Promote it:** Use our logos and copy/paste posts.
4. **Accept donations:** BTC on-chain and Lightning via BTCPay (we’ll help). Fiat via Stripe once enabled (converted to BTC per policy).
5. **Run the event:** Keep it fun—share artist stories and practical Bitcoin tips.
6. **Wrap up & report:** Send the total raised. We’ll feature the campaign (opt-in) and issue documentation where applicable.

## Tips for success
- **Bitcoin focus:** “Your zap today could fund an artist’s breakthrough tomorrow.”
- **Low cost:** Use free tools (Zoom, Canva, GitHub for tracking).
- **Incentives:** Offer “Founding Supporter” badges for $100+ donors.
